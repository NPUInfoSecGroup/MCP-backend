## 1. Executive Summary

The penetration test conducted on the target host `192.168.5.25` revealed several open ports, including DNS (53/tcp), Microsoft RPC (135/tcp), and VMware RDP (2179/tcp). The host was initially unresponsive to ICMP probes, indicating potential firewall or network filtering. Subsequent aggressive scans confirmed the presence of open services, which could expose the system to vulnerabilities if not properly secured. No immediate compromises were identified, but the presence of these services warrants further investigation and remediation to mitigate potential risks.

## 4. Vulnerability Details

### High Severity Vulnerabilities

#### HIGH-001: Exposed Microsoft RPC (135/tcp)

**Description:** Microsoft RPC service is exposed on port 135/tcp, which could be exploited for remote code execution or information disclosure.

**Impact:** Potential for remote code execution or sensitive data exposure.

**Affected Systems:** 192.168.5.25

**Remediation:** Disable unnecessary RPC services or restrict access using firewall rules. Apply the latest security patches from Microsoft.

**Evidence:**
```
Nmap scan identified open port 135/tcp.
```
**References:** CVE-2021-34527 (PrintNightmare), Microsoft Security Bulletin



#### HIGH-002: Exposed VMware RDP (2179/tcp)

**Description:** VMware RDP service is exposed on port 2179/tcp, which could be exploited for unauthorized remote access.

**Impact:** Potential for unauthorized remote access to the VMware environment.

**Affected Systems:** 192.168.5.25

**Remediation:** Restrict access to the VMware RDP service using firewall rules and ensure strong authentication mechanisms are in place.

**Evidence:**
```
Nmap scan identified open port 2179/tcp.
```
**References:** CVE-2021-21985 (VMware vCenter Server), VMware Security Advisory



### Medium Severity Vulnerabilities

#### MEDIUM-001: Exposed DNS Service (53/tcp)

**Description:** The DNS service is exposed on port 53/tcp, which could be exploited for DNS cache poisoning, zone transfers, or other DNS-related attacks.

**Impact:** Potential for information disclosure or service disruption.

**Affected Systems:** 192.168.5.25

**Remediation:** Restrict access to the DNS service using firewall rules and ensure it is properly configured to prevent unauthorized zone transfers.

**Evidence:**
```
Nmap scan identified open port 53/tcp.
```
**References:** CVE-2020-1350 (SIGRed), OWASP DNS Security

## 5. Compromised Systems

No systems were successfully compromised during the assessment.

---

## 6. Attack Paths

### Attack Path 1: Exploitation of Exposed RPC Service

**Impact:** Remote code execution leading to system compromise.

**Steps:**
1. Identify open RPC service (135/tcp).
2. Exploit known vulnerabilities (e.g., PrintNightmare).
3. Gain unauthorized access to the system.


### Attack Path 2: DNS Cache Poisoning

**Impact:** Service disruption or redirection of traffic.

**Steps:**
1. Identify exposed DNS service (53/tcp).
2. Perform DNS cache poisoning attack.
3. Redirect legitimate traffic to malicious servers.


---

## 7. Recommendations

### Immediate Priority

**Network Security:** Implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to exposed services (DNS, RPC, VMware RDP).
  
*Business Justification:* Prevents unauthorized access and reduces the attack surface.


**Patch Management:** Apply the latest security patches for Microsoft RPC and VMware RDP services.
  
*Business Justification:* Mitigates known vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code execution.


### Short-term Priority

**Service Hardening:** Disable unnecessary services (e.g., DNS, RPC) if they are not required for business operations.
  
*Business Justification:* Reduces the attack surface and minimizes potential exploitation vectors.

## 8. Technical Methodology

The assessment was conducted using the Pentesting Task Tree (PTT) methodology, which involves a structured approach to penetration testing. The process included initial port scanning, service version detection, script scanning, and vulnerability assessment. Tools such as Nmap were used to identify open ports and services, while CVE databases and Exploit-DB were referenced for known vulnerabilities.

---

## 9. Conclusion

The penetration test identified several exposed services on the target host `192.168.5.25`, which could pose significant security risks if left unaddressed. Immediate actions, such as implementing firewall rules and applying security patches, are recommended to mitigate these risks. Further testing and monitoring should be conducted to ensure the effectiveness of the remediation measures.
